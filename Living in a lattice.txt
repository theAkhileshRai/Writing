I once was a crystal, not meth,
Positioning my lattices to object.
Of colours, lines and rhythms, 
My sides conflicted what was thrown at me.

I pillowed that which caused me to dread,
Under the guise of objectivity.
Anger a reality,
that harms the bearers head.

I sift through some sanctity,
Be that as bereft,
Ploughing through causality,
Learning to accept.

I harvest this seed,
That needs no second predilection,
No fight with-in, no fight with-out,
Total internal reflection.
