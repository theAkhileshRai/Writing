Set the clocks,
For thou shall see the will to live in me.
Heed the calls to arms,
For where there is truth there shall be light,
And no man shall escape my might

There shall be no lack of justice,
By iron fists shall I rein.
O'through  fennel thin  chance, 
and lingering grace, 
This fool has thus prevailed.
